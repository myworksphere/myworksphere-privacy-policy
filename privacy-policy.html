  <h1>Development Privacy Policy for My Worksphere Application</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 02/03/2025</p>
  
  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>This Privacy Policy is provided for development and testing purposes only. It outlines how data is collected, used, stored, and deleted during the development phase of the application. This policy is subject to significant changes prior to production release.</p>
  
  <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Personal Information:</strong> Data you voluntarily provide during testing (e.g., name, email).</li>
    <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> Automatically collected data (e.g., browser type, pages visited) to help us improve the app during development.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>To test and improve our application features.</li>
    <li>To analyze usage patterns and enhance the overall user experience during development.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>Note: Data collected during this phase will not be used for commercial purposes and may be reset or removed upon updates.</em></p>
  
  <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
  <p>We store data temporarily and implement basic security measures appropriate for a development environment. These measures may change once the app transitions to production, where more robust security protocols will be applied.</p>
  
  <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
  <p>Data collected during the development phase is retained only for as long as needed for testing and improvement. Once the application moves to production, all data will be reviewed, and this policy will be revised accordingly.</p>
  
  <h2>6. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>This policy is a work in progress and will be updated before production launch. We recommend reviewing the final production version for any changes regarding data handling practices.</p>
